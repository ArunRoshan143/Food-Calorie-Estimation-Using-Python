# Food-Calorie-Estimation-Using-Python
A simple effort to predict the calorie of a fruit without actually giving its name and type.

CNN model is used to train the images and various libraries like Tensorflow and numpy is used for statistical and framework purpose.
OpenCV is used to analyse the image provided. One of the main advantag is that this model uses Thumb as an calibration to noramalise the image and predict the calories effectively.
